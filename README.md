# pandas-challenge-1
Module Challenge 4 Focused on Data Analysis with Pandas Library
Part 1: of this challenge was fairly easy to get through.  Looking at last week made is pretty easy to figure out what to do. 
Part 2:  this was fairly straight forward although the directions in the notebook, for the first block of code, led me down a path
that I found out later I didn't need to do.  (There goes 2 hours of my time!)
Part 3: suprisingly, calculations worked!  Happy to move on.
Part 4:  the 2nd bullet point "Create a summary DataFrame" was maddening.  I finally joined a study group and got some input
on this from classmate, Brandon. As I am still struggling a bit with how things are stored and called back, I will be working
with our TA's to undertand this part.

Also, worked with CHATGpt to refine some of my original code in Part 2.

Finally, I seem to be struggling with how things are named in the homework and in the class presentations. Sometimes it seems
like terms are used interchangably and that can really make things confusing for a beginner coder.
