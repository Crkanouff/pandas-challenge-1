Module Challenge 4 Focused on Data Analysis with Pandas Library
Part 1: of this challenge was fairly easy to get through.  Looking at last week made is pretty easy to figure out what to do. 
Part 2:  this was fairly straight forward although the directions in the notebook, for the first block of code, led me down a path
that I found out later I didn't need to do.  (There goes 2 hours of my time!) I did use CHATGpt to refine some of my original code in Part 2.
Part 3: suprisingly, calculations worked!  Happy to move on.
Part 4:  the 2nd bullet point "Create a summary DataFrame" was maddening.  I joined a study group and got some input
on this from classmates (Brandon) and finally, reviewed other code on github (Matt) and compared how each of them completed this section (which was very different).  Once I felt like I understood this part, at the end, used Matt's code here (just in the 2nd block) as it was easier for me to understand.

Finally, still struggling with how things are named in the homework and in the class presentations. Some terms are used interchangably and that can really make things confusing for a beginner coder.
